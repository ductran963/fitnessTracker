# Fitness Tracker

#### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this homework is to allow users to update and track their fitness records on the website application. In doing so we are using Mongo database with a Mongoose schema to handle routes with Express and loaded onto the page through html, css, JS.
